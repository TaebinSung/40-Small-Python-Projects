# 40 Python Projects

Welcome to my repository of 40 small Python projects! These projects are based on examples from a Python book I’m reading... [만들면서 배우는 파이썬과 40개의 작품들], with some being direct clones and others featuring my own modifications or enhancements.

## **About**
This repository serves as a collection of Python projects that demonstrate a variety of programming concepts, ranging from beginner-friendly to intermediate levels. The projects are either:
1. Directly cloned examples from the book.
2. Slightly modified or enhanced versions, where I’ve added personal touches or new features.

## **How to Run the Projects**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/40-python-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 40-python-projects
   ```

3. Run the desired projects:
   ```bash
   python path/to/project.py
   ```

4. Some Projects may require additional Python libries. Install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If it doesn't work, check each folder for dependencies to download


## **Disclaimer**
The original project examples belong to the author of the book. This repository is intended for learning purposes only.
I have made modifications to some projects to explore additional features or implement my own ideas.

## **Why I Created This Repository**
This repository is a personal learning project to:
  1. Practice and reinforce Python programming concepts
  2. Experiment with modifying and enhancing existing examples.
  3. Serve as a resource for others learning Python to explore and build upon.
